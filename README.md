# Download manager

*This project is still WIP. The basics work but it has not yet been extensively tested and is missing most of the core features that would be needed to make it useful.*

This is a download manager library implemented in Rust. It can download one file with multiple simaltaneous connections by requesting the file in chunks with HTTP Range requests.

It also supports automatic resumption of an interrupted download.
